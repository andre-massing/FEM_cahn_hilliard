### L2- gradient flow is arising from the energy functional.
  - Do we require the energy funtional to be a lyaponov function? (Cahn hilliard is)
  - Is it possible to construct a energy functiona by combining lots of funny physics?
  - Can we then still require it to be a lyaponov function?

### Models for protein folding:
  - Brusselat

### Single Cell Migration
  - Dynamic curvatures impacts cell motion, but the mechanics is uknown.
  - Curvature leads to internal pressure
  - The process of dynamics environments around a cell and its movements is called Curvotaxis
