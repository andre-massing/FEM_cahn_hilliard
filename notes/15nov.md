# Line tension on lipid rafts related to HIV
Line tension at lipid phase boundaries as driving force for HIV fusion peptide-mediated fusion
Sung-Tae Yang, Volker Kiessling & Lukas K. Tamm

Lipids and proteins are organized in cellular membranes in clusters, often called ‘lipid rafts’. Although raft-constituent ordered lipid domains are thought to be energetically unfavourable for membrane fusion, rafts have long been implicated in many biological fusion processes. For the case of HIV gp41-mediated membrane fusion, this apparent contradiction can be resolved by recognizing that the interfaces between ordered and disordered lipid domains are the predominant sites of fusion.

- High membrane tension hinder endocytosis (fission).  Endocytosis is a cellular process in which substances (vesicles) are brought into the cell.

 - High membrane tension favors exocytosis (fusion of vesicles).
