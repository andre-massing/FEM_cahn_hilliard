 - Membrane inertia.
   Equation (5) implies that the fluid and the
membrane are always in local equilibrium. This means that
the inertia of the membrane itself is neglected (otherwise an
additional acceleration term would appear [78, 111, 112]). 


- Lipid Rafts. Specialized regions in membranes of highly packed and ordered lipids, more rigid than the rest of the membrane since it is consisting of cholestoerol to glue then together and remained intact when they did experiments to solubilize the membrane. They can move in the membrane and form larger rafts or brake down to smaller ones!  Proteins with special properties are linked to this rafts, signaling proteins (GPCR, RTK), True resident proteins (Caveolin, GPI anchored proteins, Flotillin) and cytoskeletal proteins/adhesion molecules (Integrins, Cadherin). 

Type I Lipid raft: Full of Caveolin endocytocis. Type II Lipids rafts Enriched with Flotillin (very much in neurocells). 
 
- Membrane fluidity:
Lipids are fatty acid phospholipids ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43385748/201779259-d7201ba9-5e7a-4e5d-864f-a3e2b67ddbe5.png) High temps tends to increase fluidity since the tension between lipids are smaller. 

Cholesterol is at low temp increasing the distance between the lipids, which is as well increasing the lipid fluidity. And at high temperature does decrease the distane of the lipids which is reducing the fluidity. Hence, cholestorol is a buffer when temperature is increasing. 

The lipid tails can be saturated or unsaturated. If the lipids are saturated, then the tails of the lipids are straight and nice with no fancy bondings, hence the fluidity is decreasing. With unsaturated lipids they tends to have more distance which is increasing the fluidity.
