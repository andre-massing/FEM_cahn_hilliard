### Solving the Biharmonic Equation using a Continuous Interior Penalty Method

I did my specialization project at Norwegian University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Andr√© Massing.

The goal of the thesis was to
- State the issues that arise when solving the biharmonic equation
- Derive the continious penalty method method based on the work done by Gu`s [PhD Dissertation](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/1744/)
- Derive stability and apriori estimates.
- Verify the estimates numerically.

The thesis should be digestible for graduate students with basic knowledge within FEM methods and numerical analysis.
