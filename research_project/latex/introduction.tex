% Why are cell membrane dynamics important

First can we detect deceases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer cells and develop new methods and vaccines \cite{small2006sorting}. One of the primary components of the cell membranes are lipids which serve many different functions. A key function is that it is consisting of a bilayer of lipids which controls the structural rigidity and the fluidity of the membrane \cite{ neidleman87}. It also turns out that the lipids often accumulate into so-called lipid rafts which serves as a rigid platform for proteins with special properties such as intracellular trafficking of lipids and lipid-anchored proteins \cite{Edidin03}.

Modelling of lipid rafts formation can be modelled as a two-phase separation problem based on minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional \cite{yushutin19}
\[
\mathcal{E}_{ch}  \left( \Gamma  \right) = \int_{\Gamma  }^{}\Psi \left( c \right) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \left\lvert \nabla c \right\rvert^{2} dx,
\]
which is describing the chemical energy for a concentration $c: \Gamma \times \left[ 0,T \right] \mapsto  \left[ 0,1 \right]  $ over a surface membrane $\Gamma$. Several authors have solved this problem often results by deriving variants of Cahn
Hilliard Equation or Allen Cahn Equation if the concentration is not conserved both standstill and evolving domains \cite{yushutin19, ratz16,Gera2017, caetano21,yushutin19} .

Assuming that the system is a single-phase system can the elastic bending energy be modelled using the Canham Helrich energy functional \cite{wang08} \[
\mathcal{E} _{e}\left( \Gamma  \right) =   \int_{\Gamma }^{}  c_{b} H^{2} + c_{k} K  dx
\].

Here is $H = \frac{ \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 }{2}$ denoted as the mean curvature and $K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$ as the gaussian curvature with respectively $c_{b}$ and $c_{k}$ as tuning parameters and $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ as principal curvatures. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem can it be shown that the problem above is equivalent to the Willmore energy
functional \cite[Ch 8.5 Thm 8.29]{montiel2009curves},

\[
\mathcal{E} \left( \Gamma  \right) = \int_{\Gamma }^{}  H ^2 dx
\]

This is a well known problem in the mathematical community and since it describes lipid

and there has been developed both ananlytical and numerical tools to handle this problem.

In general can this functional be established as
In this report will we establish a numerical scheme on minimization on this functional.However, we will first establish notation by including a section for definitions and important results from differential geometry. We will then derive  the
underlying PDE's for this equation. Lastly we will establish the model for the problem and discretize the problem using evolationary parametric FEM methods.
