Two semi-iterative procedures are considered for obtaining the solution of the resulting coupled system of algebraic equations. It is shown that the rate of convergence of the iterative procedures depends upon the choice of the difference approximation. Estimates for optimum iteration parameters are given and several comparisons are made. An attempt is made to unify the ideas on the splitting technique for solving the first biharmonic boundary value problem. }

 abstract = { ▪ Abstract Lipid raft microdomains were conceived as part of a mechanism for the intracellular trafficking of lipids and lipid-anchored proteins. The raft hypothesis is based on the behavior of defined lipid mixtures in liposomes and other model membranes. Experiments in these well-characterized systems led to operational definitions for lipid rafts in cell membranes. These definitions, detergent solubility to define components of rafts, and sensitivity to cholesterol deprivation to define raft functions implicated sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in many cell functions. Despite extensive work, the basis for raft formation in cell membranes and the size of rafts and their stability are all uncertain. Recent work converges on very small rafts <10 nm in diameter that may enlarge and stabilize when their constituents are cross-linked. }

As the width of the diffuse interface shrinks to zero one expects a convergence towards a surface Hele-Shaw model. While results from formal matched asymptotic expansions confirm this conjecture, a numerical reproduction of this asymptotic behavior has not been provided, yet. It is the purpose of this contribution, to fill this gap and present a rotationally symmetric example on the standard sphere, where analytic expressions for the surface Hele-Shaw model allow a comparison with numerical results for the surface Cahn–Hilliard equation.}
